# ðŸ”„ COMBINE Mode Implementation Summary

## What Changed

The Google Sheets export now uses **COMBINE mode** instead of REPLACE mode.

## How It Works

### Before (REPLACE mode):
- Upload screenshots â†’ Process â†’ **Delete all existing data** â†’ Add only new data
- Result: Lost all previous tournament data

### Now (COMBINE mode):
1. **Read existing leaderboard** from Google Sheet
2. **Process new screenshots** and extract player data  
3. **Combine data intelligently**:
   - Existing players: Add new stats to their totals
   - New players: Add to leaderboard
4. **Update sheet** with combined data

## Example

**Existing leaderboard:**
- HEARTMADDI: 15 kills, 8 deaths, 3 games
- PLAYER2: 10 kills, 5 deaths, 2 games

**New screenshots:**
- HEARTMADDI: 5 kills, 2 deaths, 1 game
- PLAYER3: 7 kills, 1 death, 1 game

**Result after COMBINE:**
- HEARTMADDI: **20 kills, 10 deaths, 4 games** âœ… (15+5, 8+2, 3+1)
- PLAYER2: **10 kills, 5 deaths, 2 games** âœ… (preserved)
- PLAYER3: **7 kills, 1 death, 1 game** âœ… (new player added)

## Benefits

âœ… **Cumulative tracking** - True tournament leaderboard across all matches
âœ… **Data preservation** - Never lose existing player statistics  
âœ… **Smart merging** - Same duplicate detection, now with historical data
âœ… **Accurate math** - Simple addition ensures reliability

## UI Changes

## Technical Implementation

- Modified `export_to_google_sheets()` function in `fortnite_processor.py`
- Added 5-step process: Read â†’ Process â†’ Combine â†’ Validate â†’ Update
- Maintains same username normalization for accurate player matching
- Added detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Batch updates for better performance
