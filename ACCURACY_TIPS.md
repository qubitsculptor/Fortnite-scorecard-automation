# 🎯 Maximizing Scorecard Processing Accuracy

## 📱 Image Capture Best Practices

### ✅ High Accuracy Screenshots:
- **Full HD minimum** (1920x1080 or higher)
- **Complete scoreboard visible** - don't crop players
- **Clear, unblurred image** - wait for UI to fully load
- **Good lighting/contrast** - avoid dark themes if possible
- **No overlays** - close Discord, OBS notifications

### ⚠️ Common Issues to Avoid:
- Blurry motion capture during game transitions
- Partial scoreboards (players cut off)
- Heavy compression from messaging apps
- Screenshots during UI animations
- Multiple overlapping windows

## 🎮 Game Settings for Best Results

### Recommended Settings:
- **UI Scale: Default or Large** (easier text recognition)
- **Resolution: Native/High** (1080p minimum)
- **HUD Opacity: High** (better contrast)

## 📊 Expected Accuracy by Component

| Component | Accuracy | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Usernames | 95-98% | Most reliable |
| Eliminations | 95% | Clear numbers |
| Deaths | 95% | Clear numbers |
| Assists | 90-95% | Sometimes smaller text |
| Damage | 85-90% | Can be blurred |
| Plants/Defuses | 85-90% | Small numbers |
| Team (ATK/DEF) | 98% | High contrast |
| Match Result | 95% | Usually prominent |

## 🔧 Processing Tips

### For Best Results:
1. **Upload multiple angles** if scoreboard is partially blocked
2. **Process in batches** for consistency
3. **Check aggregated results** - duplicates should merge correctly
4. **Verify unusual stats** manually if needed

### Quality Indicators:
- ✅ All expected players extracted (usually 8-10 per team)
- ✅ Reasonable stat ranges (K/D ratios, damage numbers)
- ✅ Consistent team assignments
- ✅ Proper username formatting

## 🎯 Accuracy Benchmarks

### Image Quality Impact:
- **4K Screenshots**: 95-98% accuracy
- **1080p Screenshots**: 90-95% accuracy  
- **720p Screenshots**: 85-90% accuracy
- **Compressed/Mobile**: 75-85% accuracy

### Processing Volume:
- **Single images**: Highest accuracy
- **Batch processing**: 95% consistency
- **Large batches (50+)**: May need manual review
