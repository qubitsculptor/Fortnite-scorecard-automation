# üîó Google Sheets Integration Setup

## Required for Auto-Update Feature

Since you want the system to automatically update your existing leaderboard Google Sheet, you'll need to set up Google Sheets API access.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Create Google Cloud Project
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Click "Select a project" ‚Üí "New Project"
3. Name it "Fortnite Leaderboard" 
4. Click "Create"

### 2. Enable Google Sheets API
1. In your new project, go to "APIs & Services" ‚Üí "Library"
2. Search for "Google Sheets API"
3. Click on it and click "Enable"

### 3. Create Service Account
1. Go to "APIs & Services" ‚Üí "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "Service Account"
3. Name: "Fortnite Stats Bot"
4. Description: "Automated scorecard processor"
5. Click "Create and Continue"
6. Skip roles (click "Continue")
7. Click "Done"

### 4. Download Credentials
1. In the Credentials page, find your service account
2. Click on it to open details
3. Go to "Keys" tab
4. Click "Add Key" ‚Üí "Create New Key"
5. Choose "JSON" format
6. Click "Create"
7. **Save the downloaded file as `credentials.json` in your project folder**

### 5. Share Your Google Sheet
1. Open your existing leaderboard Google Sheet
2. Click "Share" button
3. **Add the service account email** (found in credentials.json as "client_email")
   - It looks like: `fortnite-stats@your-project-name.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
4. Give it "Editor" permissions
5. Click "Send"

### 6. Get Your Sheet ID
1. From your Google Sheet URL: 
   `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/YOUR_SHEET_ID/edit`
2. Copy the `YOUR_SHEET_ID` part
3. Add it to your `.env` file:
   ```
   GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=YOUR_SHEET_ID
   ```

## File Structure You'll Need

```
fortnite-scorecard/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ credentials.json          ‚Üê The file you downloaded
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                     ‚Üê Your API keys
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app_new.py              ‚Üê Main application
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ fortnite_processor.py   ‚Üê Processing engine
```

## Your .env File Should Look Like:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your_actual_sheet_id_here
GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS_FILE=credentials.json
WORKSHEET_NAME=Sheet1
ENABLE_DUPLICATE_CHECK=true
```

## Testing the Connection

Once set up:
1. Run the app locally: `streamlit run app_new.py`
2. Upload a test screenshot
3. Click "Export to Google Sheets"
4. Check your Google Sheet - it should auto-update!

## Security Notes

- **Keep `credentials.json` secure** - it's like a password
- **Add `credentials.json` to `.gitignore`** so it's not uploaded to GitHub
- **For deployment**, upload the credentials content as environment variables

## Troubleshooting

**"Permission denied"** ‚Üí Make sure you shared the sheet with the service account email
**"Sheet not found"** ‚Üí Double-check your GOOGLE_SHEET_ID in the .env file
**"API not enabled"** ‚Üí Make sure Google Sheets API is enabled in your project

Once this is set up, your leaderboard will update automatically every time you process scorecards! üéØ
